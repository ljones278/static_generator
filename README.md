# static_generator
Creates static filled .wav files from input files for easy communication with fellow followers of the Omnissiah.

Very simple at the moment, I may come back to it and make it more clever in the future.

Change the input file name to change the file to be converted. Don't see any reason why you would want to change the output file name...

Dependencies: Numpy, Scipy
